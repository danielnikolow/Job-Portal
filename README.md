1️⃣ Project Description

This is an application entirely for searching for jobs as programmers. As a user, upon registration, you must choose between a candidate role or an employer role depending on whether you are looking for a job as a programmer or want to publish a job advertisement for programmers.

Candidates can apply for any open position, and for this purpose they are previously required to create their own Cv in the create Cv section and download it as a PDF file, since job applications in this application are only made via a PDF file (Cv). Candidates can review their applications, delete them, create Cvs, edit them and download them as PDF files.

They can also create job alerts, which accept certain criteria and requirements set by themselves. These job alerts, each time a new programmer advertisement is released, monitor whether their criteria and requirements that you have set for them match those of the advertisement and if they match, then send a notification of a successful match in the notifications section.

Employers can post job postings and view applications for them in the applications section. They can open and view CVs associated with a candidate's applications and edit their interview/rejected/offer status, as well as delete them.

3️⃣ Instructions for installing and running the project

For the most convenient way in IntelliJ IDEA, click Get from Version Vontrol and enter the link to my repository that you want to download and start.

In this case, it is https://github.com/danielnikolow/Job-Portal. Then click Clone. When loading the structure and files, you may initially see a notification that says Maven build scripts found.

You must click the load button in this notification, otherwise the project will not be able to start working. If you do not see it or it is hidden, then you will definitely find it in Notifications (at the top right, the bell under the X button to close IntelliJ IDEA).

Once you have done this, all that remains is to start both projects, most conveniently through the Application class, which is located in both projects to start the application.
